* adjacency
- with (3, 3)
  valid:
    - (3, 2)
    - (3, 4)
    - (4, 3)
    - (4, 2)
    - (2, 2)
    - (4, 4)
    - (2, 4)
  invalid: all else eg,
    - (2, 15)
    - (10, 2)
    - (5, 11)


* zone of control
- always size 3
- with (devin at (13, 9) facing SOUTH)
  valid:
    - (12, 10)
    - (13, 10)
    - (14, 10)
  invalid: all else eg
    - (1, 3)
    - (13, 9)
    - (12 9)
- with (heth at (8, 8) facing EAST)
  valid:
    - (9, 7)
    - (9, 8)
    - (9, 9)
  invalid: all else eg
    - (8, 8)
    - (8, 9)
    - (7, 8)




* units occupying entry point = removed
* no stacked units at end of movement step
* any attempt to stack = GbgInvalidMoveException. eg. move into occupied square
* no passing through zone of control
* valid move from v1
* must call getBattlesToResolve at the end of movement step...else GbgInvalidActionException
* multiple calls to getBattlesToResolve and resolveBattle
* ensure piece can only battle once per turn (A&D)
* AELIM/DELIM = all units removed
*** unit may occupy in this case
* EXCHANGE lower end units removed, other remove units with equal or more combat factor





notes:
* battle resolution:
*** sum combat factors of A & D
*** compute odds = A/D
*** odds >= 2.0 -> DELIM
*** 0.5 < odds & odds < 2.0 -> EXCHANGE
*** odds <= 0.5 -> AELIM

* ability to choose battle order
* must resolve against every enemy unit within ZOC of at least one attacking unit
* varies based on facing (not in v2)
* total attack/defense factors
